# Advanced-Machine-Learning-Lab


MANDATORY TASKS (10p)

LAB 1:

Basic_intro (2p)

Create a NN network with 5 layers. Train and test the model. (2p) 
-) Choose a dataset (CSV or any other image dataset).
-) Utilize the dataloader.
-) Design the NN model.
-) Train and test the model.
 

LAB 2:

Computer Vision Lab (3p)

Design a CNN model and compare it with an MLP (0.5p)
Data augmentation on image dataset (e.g., rotating and cropping) (0.5p)
Fine-tune pretrained models (Choose 2 pretrained models and compare their accuracy): (2p)
by freezing weights
reconstructing the layers
 

LAB 3:

Language Models Lab (2.5p)

Compare RNN, LSTM, and GRU with perplexity (0.5p)
Implement GRU in the first Notebook
Implement Skip-gram and compare embedding layers with CBOW (1p)
Adapt/expand the text classifier in notebook 2 within the language models lab, for example one of these: (1p)
Book or character name -> writer
Game's titles > company or genre
Any word -> language
Whatever you can think it can be classified
 

LAB 4:

Generative Models Lab (2.5p)

Interpolate from one latent space to another latent space and visualize the transition using VAE (0.5p)
Implement and test Conditional VAE (cVAE) (1p)
Test VAE and GAN (or any of their variations) using another task or dataset than FashionMNIST or MNIST, and compare both approaches (1p) 


Complementary:

Language Models (3p)
Fine-tune any of the hugginface models to any specific task you are interested on such as: (1.5p)
Generation of quests
Chatbot
Recipe generation
Your own idea!
Implement and test Pytorchâ€™s own Transformer models for machine translation
Analyze and reflect on the output and how it works. (0.5p)
Use RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, or Transformer for text generation (1p)
Names based on countries
Cities based on countries
Game ideas based on genres
